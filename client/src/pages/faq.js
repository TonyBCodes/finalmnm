Therefore, we work with the host to purchase alcohol used during the event.  Mix And Ming will provide the host with the types and amounts of alcohol to be purchased based on their drink selection.  The event bartender may pick up and deliver the alcohol to the event so the alcohol can be portioned for use druing the event.  All extra alcohol is delivered to and retained by the host.

That said, consider the following practical advice when selecting cocktails.  Some people like light alcohols while others like dark alcohols so having an understanding the prefernce of the participants will ensure everyone will mix several drinks they like.  The number of different alcohol types required to mix the cocktails will have influence on the cost as more types of alcohol will need to be purchased when selecting drinks made from different spirit types.  Alcohol, mixers, fruit, garnish and mixing tools are typically placed on the table to be in reach of the participants.  Keep in mind the amount of space allowed by your table size and type and by the venue set up.
